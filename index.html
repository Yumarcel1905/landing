				<p>
				Hello, I’m Marceline, the founder of Capture Moment. Photography has been my passion and my creative outlet for as long as I can remember. With a camera in hand, I’ve explored over 30 countries, capturing unique stories and unforgettable scenes. For me, photography isn’t just about creating beautiful images; it’s a way to connect with the world and freeze memories that resonate with people on a personal level.
